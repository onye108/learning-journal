<h1>Code 201 Learning Journal: Day 8</h1>
<p>I learned a lesson to remember. Don't miss a day of class. I was totally derailed by missing one lecture. After hours trial and error of patience from my TA i was able to grasp the concept of creating HTML elements with Javascript. I still need more practice with it but, getting caught up from missing one day has been overwhelming.</p>
