<h1>Code 201: Day 5</h1>
<p>I'm learning, first-hand, that the trade of Coding is a craft, puzzle and an art that has to be persistently polished. Studying, practicing and collaborating on a constant basis is what grows you and there's really no substitute for those three . I recognized that I'm not giving that effort and concentration, and repetition that's needed to be a solid coder. I see that I need to cut out the distractions and get back to the regimented, discipline life-style that I learned when going through Tech School. Because Git and nested functions kicked my ass. On a positive note, I am now able to recognize functions, loops, events and methods in video games and live websites. Just a moment of reflection on Week 1.</p>
