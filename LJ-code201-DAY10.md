<h1> Code 201 Learning Journal : Day 10</h1>

<p> I'm starting to learn first-hand that coding has it's highs and lows. After finishing Week 1's project I was disappointed with the finished product after learning new skills in week 2 that could've came in handy in week 1. Then came week 2 which made me question if I wanted to keep going down this road of coding. But then today, just felt good. I'm grasping the goal and concept of this project better than I thought, which has really got me enthused about tomorrow. </p>
