<h1>Code Fellow: Learning Journal Day 15</h1>
<p>Floating in the world learning most things the long and hard way, makes realize I need a mentor. I'm 30 years old with only a slight idea of where I'm going, and even less an idea how I'll get there.
Being more sociable and reaching out for help is something I struggle with as well.  I'm learning that my biggest obstacle in this journal is the Old Me. </p>
